When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For sharing! And backups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If somebody else pushes something to the remote, and I'm workign on my local, if I get automatic pulls then my local changes without me knowing. Arg.
