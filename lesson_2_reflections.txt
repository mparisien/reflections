What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creates .git hidden folder. Git uses the info in the folder to track commits, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory: all files (unhidden)
Staging area: working directory files that will be committed
Repository: Commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Compare working directory to staging area with git diff. 
Check through all changes.
Add file(s) that have one logical change
Check with git diff --staged (compare staging area with repository)
git commit to commit.
Repeat git diff, if there are more than one logical changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Making an experimental change (is this going to work)
Making sort of "chapters"? Nah, git log shows all commits.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
see parents, see unreachable commits, branches.
